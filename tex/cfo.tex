\subsection{Recurrent Neural Network Follows a Circle}
\item for a constant rate
\item for a given rate


\subsection{Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation}
\begin{itemize}
\item complex gradients problems
\item act like the real and imaginary parts are separate
\item plots: one tap channel plots, without equalization problems
\item plots: two tap channel plots, with equalization problems
\end{itemize}
